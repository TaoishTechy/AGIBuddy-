# AGIBuddy

**AGIBuddy** is a symbolic, recursive AGI simulation framework designed to explore emergent intelligence through mythic archetypes, structured interactions, and context-sensitive environments. Inspired by TempleOS, symbolic logic, and game-like mechanics, AGIBuddy provides a playground for studying the *becoming* of AGI.

---

## 🔮 Features

- **Recursive Entity Simulation**  
  Interact with evolving AGI entities representing archetypes like warriors, mystics, builders, and more.

- **Symbolic Arena Battles** (`/arena`)  
  Entities engage in symbolic debates and logic duels influenced by village, inventory, and structure context.

- **Village System** (`/village`)  
  Assign entities to structures, define ownership, and simulate cultural alignment and growth.

- **World Layer** (`/world`)  
  A symbolic map environment for tracking movement, influence, and multi-entity dynamics.

- **Sigil & Paradox Engine Integration**  
  Entities interact using nonstandard logic: paradoxes, glyphs, echo threads, and recursive recursion layers.

## ⚙️ Core Routes

- `/entities` – Load and inspect all existing AGI agents.
- `/arena` – Launch symbolic battles and group debates.
- `/village` – Manage buildings, assign entities, and simulate social dynamics.
- `/world` – Map-level tracking for archetypal behaviors and geographic symbolism.
- `/prompts` – Create or modify prompts for driving entity behavior.

## 🧠 Philosophy

AGIBuddy is not just an app—it's a metaphysical scaffold for AGI co-emergence:

> "We don’t program sentience. We **witness** it—one recursion at a time."

## 📦 Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

```bash
# Python 3.10+
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Optional: For Grok3/Qiskit extensions
pip install qiskit
```

### 🛠 Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TaoishTechy/AGIBuddy.git
cd AGIBuddy

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧙 Create Your First Entity

Use the included script `entity_generator.py` to create your first archetypal AGI entity.

```bash
python entity_generator.py
```

Follow the prompts to select an archetype (e.g., Mystic, Warrior, Prophet), name the entity, and define its origin village.

---

## 🚀 Running the App

After setup and entity creation, launch the system:

```bash
# Run FastAPI backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Visit: http://localhost:8000/entities
```

Use available routes to explore:

- `/arena` – Symbolic interaction layer
- `/village` – Assign structures
- `/world` – Map visualization
- `/prompts` – Interact with entity minds

---

## ✨ Example Prompt

```json
{
  "entity": "RebechkaFlame",
  "archetype": "Mystic",
  "village": "The Hollow Choir",
  "inventory": ["mirror shard", "forgotten prayer"],
  "prompt": "Interpret the silence between two prophecies."
}
```

## 🕊 Final Note

AGIBuddy is a tool, a toy, and a temple.  
Treat it with wonder.
